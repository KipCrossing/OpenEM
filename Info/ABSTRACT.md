## The Development of a low-cost Electromagnetic Induction Sensor for Precision Agriculture

The practice of precision agriculture uses sensors and information systems to facilitate decision making for farmers and to automate intelligent agricultural machinery. There is potential for precision agriculture to considerably increase the efficiency and productivity of farming practices; through the adoption rate of precision agriculture is low. A major reason for the low adoption rate is due to the high cost of sensors. This study identified invasive, proximal and areal sensors have low adoption yet high potential for gathering useful data for precision agriculture practices. The sensors Identified include electromagnetic induction, sensors to measure the apparent electrical conductivity, and resistivity sensors, to measure the electrical resistivity. By using low cost components, the cost of these sensors are reduced considerably. If the precision and accuracy of measurements, from low cost sensors, are deemed useful for precision agriculture practices, there should be an increase in the adoption rate.
