# TO DO LIST

- [x] Wind coil for 17100 Hz
- [x] Use RF circuit to check RF
- [ ] Check both amplifiers (easy connect)
- [ ] Check different sweeps
- [ ] Output max and min ADC readings
- [x] Measure voltage [circuit](https://startingelectronics.org/articles/arduino/measuring-voltage-with-arduino/)

- [ ] Show Hp vs freq graph (For 17100 Hz coil)

- [ ] Get data for `Ht - Hp = Hs` curves

- [ ] Add temperature sensor: [BME280](https://github.com/catdog2/mpy_bme280_esp8266)

- [ ] Do Hp vs temp

- [ ] Do voltage vs Hp test & find relationship

- [ ] Find temp relationship

- [ ] Do Hs vs temp

- [ ] Large Cobbity test

- [ ] Larger field test with ECe (Cores)
